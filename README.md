# 🌐 CircleLogic v2: Objects in Orbit
“When two circles collide, only their essence decides if they’re truly the same.”

## 🔍 Overview
CircleLogic v2 is a refined Java class that models a circle with attributes like radius and color, and introduces object comparison through the testSecondObj method. This version is perfect for learners exploring constructors, encapsulation, and object-oriented logic with emotional clarity and technical precision.

## 🚀 Features
• 	✅ Constructor-based initialization
• 	🧠 Attribute encapsulation (radius,color )
• 	🔍 Object comparison via testSecondObj
• 	📐 Area calculation using Math.PI (optional from v1)
• 	🎨 Color-based identity logic

## 💡 Sample Usage
Circle c1 = new Circle(5.0, "Red");
Circle c2 = new Circle(5.0, "Red");

if (c1.testSecondObj(c2)) {
    System.out.println("The circles are identical.");
} else {
    System.out.println("The circles are different.");
}
## 📁 File Structure

        └── Circle.java

## 🧠 Object Comparison Logic
public boolean testSecondObj(Circle c1) {
    return this.radius == c1.radius && this.color.equals(c1.color);
}
🔸 Uses .equals for string comparison
🔸 Checks both radius and color for equality
🔸 Returns true only if both match
